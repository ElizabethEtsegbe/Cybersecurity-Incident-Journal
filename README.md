## Cybersecurity Incident Scenario

**Incident Type:** Data Breach

**Date and Time:** October 15, 2023, 10:30 AM

**Description:** A cybersecurity incident occurred at Lamai Corporation, a leading financial services company. The incident involved unauthorized access to sensitive customer data, including personally identifiable information (PII) and financial records. An external threat actor gained access to the company's database containing customer information.

In this journal entry, we document a cybersecurity incident and provide a structured analysis based on the 5 W's - Who, What, Where, When, and Why.

**The 5 W's**

- **Who:** An organized group of unethical hackers
- **What:** A ransomware security incident
- **Where:** At a health care company
- **When:** Tuesday, 9:00 a.m.
- **Why:** The incident happened because unethical hackers were able to access the company's systems using a phishing attack. After gaining access, the attackers launched their ransomware on the company's systems, encrypting critical files. The attackers' motivation appears to be financial because the ransom note they left demanded a large sum of money in exchange for the decryption key.

**Incident Details:**

- Unauthorized access was detected through anomalous activities on the network.
- The threat actor exploited a known vulnerability in the web application to gain initial access.
- The threat actor exfiltrated a substantial amount of customer data.
